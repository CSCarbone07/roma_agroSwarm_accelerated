# AgroSwarm Accelerated

AgroSwarm Accelerated is a swarm robotics simulator that simplifies the visual simulation to produce large amounts of iterations quickly.
Results for simulated experiments with an aerial swarm coverage over a field of weeds is presented at:

* [Monitoring and Mapping of Crop Fields with UAV Swarms Based on Information Gain](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-92790-5_24)

This simulator was extended to build **[AgroSwarm](https://github.com/CSCarbone07/roma_quad_ai/)** a high fidelity simulator that includes photorealistic simulation of fields and highly realistic UAV dynamics.
